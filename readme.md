 ****Creational****

  Based on the concept of creating an object.

 _**Class**_

 _Factory Method_

This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.

 _**Object**_

 _Abstract Factory_

Creates an instance of several families of classes without detailing concrete classes.

 _Builder_

Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same type of object.

 _Prototype_

A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning.

 _Singleton_

A class with only a single instance with global access points.

 ****Structural****

  Based on the idea of building blocks of objects.

 _**Class**_

 _Adapter_

Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.

 _**Object**_

 _Adapter_

Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.

 _Bridge_

Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently.

 _Composite_

A structure of simple and composite objects which makes the total object more than just the sum of its parts.

 _Decorator_

Dynamically add alternate processing to objects.

 _Facade_

A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.

 _Flyweight_

A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that is contained elsewhere.

 _Proxy_

A place holder object representing the true object.

 ****Behavioral****

  Based on the way objects play and work together.

 _**Class**_

 _Interpreter_

A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language.

 _Template  
       Method_

Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defer the exact steps to a subclass.

 _**Object**_

 _Chain of  
      Responsibility_

A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request.

 _Command_

Encapsulate a command request as an object to enable, logging and/or queuing of requests, and provides error-handling for unhandled requests.

 _Iterator_

Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection.

 _Mediator_

Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.

 _Memento_

Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.

 _Observer_

A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.

 _State_

Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.

 _Strategy_

Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation.

 _Visitor_

Adds a new operation to a class without changing the class.
